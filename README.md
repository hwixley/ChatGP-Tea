# ChatGP-Tea CLI ‚òïÔ∏è
A CLI for talking to ChatGPT, saving conversation logs, and turning code blocks (language agnostic) from it's responses into executable shell commands.

## Setup

1. Create an API key on the OpenAI developer portal, and run the following command:
    ```
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
    ```

2. Run the setup script. This will add the `gptea` alias for your script in `.bashrc` for easy execution in any directory, and add local directories (`generated-scripts/` and `conversations/`) for saving ChatGPT generated files or conversations.
   ```
   chmod +x setup.sh && source setup.sh
   ```

3. You are good to go! ü§† Run `gptea` to get started
