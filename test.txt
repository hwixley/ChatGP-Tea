Unfortunately, a bash command cannot fully validate an email using regex. However, the following bash command can be used to apply a basic email regex pattern and check if a certain string matches:

```bash
if [[ "$string" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$ ]]; then
    echo "Valid email!"
else
    echo "Invalid email :("
fi
```

Note that this regex only matches a subset of valid email addresses and may produce false positives or negatives. It is recommended to use a more comprehensive and tested regex library or service for full email validation.
